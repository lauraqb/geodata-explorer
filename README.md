# Geodata explorer

## Requirements:

- User Signup and Login (dummy): After signup, it sotres the data in localstorage. This is used to validate the login. If I had more time I would have set email validation, password requirements, and also I would have granted permissions to see the rest of the website if loggedIn is true.
- API Integration: Ticketmaster. Given a country code, the api endpoint give a list of events along with the latitude and longitude.
- Map Integration: Google Maps API
- Design and Usability: If I had more time I would have work in the styles, and I would have improved the usability for the log in and sign up. Also, in the Map page, for the country code search, I would have include a list of options. For the map position, I would have render it again after a new country search with the new position.
