# Geodata explorer

## Requirements:

- User Signup and Login (dummy)
- API Integration: Ticketmaster
- Map Integration: Google Maps API
- Design and Usability: You can decide the details of UI/UX, e.g., the colour
  palette, shapes, radius, fonts, layout, but the application should be easy to use
  and visually pleasant.
- (Bonus) User Interaction: Implement at least one feature that enhances user
  interaction with the map, such as filtering data points, searching for specific
  criteria, or updating data in real-time.

# How to start

npm run dev

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
